This is the repository of the old JS Socialvoid client that worked on Node.js and was bundled via Webpack only. It is used for testing only now. The JS Socialvoid client was rewrote to work on Deno and it can be backported into Node.js, and bundled for browsers with either Deno or Webpack and all of it's code is a single base and its repository is [here](https://github.com/intellivoid/SocialvoidJS).
